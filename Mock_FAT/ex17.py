# WAP to check whether two input string are isomorphic or not.

# Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is a one-to-one mapping possible for every character of str1 to every character of str2. And all occurrences of every character in ‘str1’ map to the same character in ‘str2’.

# Sample input:
# aab
# xxy
# Sample output:
# True

# Sample input:
# aab
# xyz
# Sample output
# False
